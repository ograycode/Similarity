#Similarity

Similarity is a library for comparing strings and getting how similar they are. It will return a percentage after normalizing the strings and stripping them of punctuation.

##Usage
Just require similarity.rb and use it by ```Similarity.compare "first string" "second string"```. It can also be used as a command line tool

```$ ruby main.rb "first string" "second string" ```

```> 50.0 ```
